# Notebooks

This repository contains Google Colab notebooks related to the fine-tuning of machine learning models, primarily large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). The focus is on practical experimentation, optimization techniques, and advanced training methods such as GRPO fine-tuning for reasoning.

## ðŸ“Œ Contents
- Fine-tuning LLMs
- Fine-tuning VLMs
- GRPO fine-tuning for reasoning
- Other model training and experimentation

## ðŸš€ Usage
- Open any `.ipynb` file in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to run and modify the notebooks.
- Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed as specified within each notebook.
